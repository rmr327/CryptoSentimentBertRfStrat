**Summary**

This Python GitHub automation template is designed to enhance your development workflow by incorporating a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automation process. With this template, you can effortlessly set up a CI/CD pipeline for your Python projects, automating routine tasks and ensuring efficient collaboration.

By implementing a CI/CD workflow, you can achieve the following benefits:

- **Automated Testing:** Ensure that your code is thoroughly tested before it gets deployed, reducing the likelihood of bugs or issues in production.

- **Streamlined Deployment:** Automate the deployment process, making it faster, more reliable, and consistent across different environments.

- **Code Quality Checks:** Enforce code quality standards and best practices, ensuring that your project maintains high standards of readability, maintainability, and performance.

- **Simplified Collaboration:** Facilitate seamless code sharing and transfer between team members and environments, making it easier to collaborate on projects.

With the option to develop in the cloud using GitHub Code Spaces, you can further enhance your productivity and eliminate the need for local setup and configuration.

**What is Code Spaces?**

GitHub Code Spaces provides cloud-hosted development environments for your repositories. It allows you to develop entirely in the cloud, eliminating the need for local setup and configuration.

**Getting Started**

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Repository:** 
   - Click the "Use this template" button or manually create a new repository using this template as a starting point.

2. **Set Up CI/CD:** 
   - Define your CI/CD workflows by configuring the `.github/workflows/` directory. Modify the workflows to suit your project's specific needs. 

3. **Start Code Space (Optional):**
   - If you want to develop entirely in the cloud, click the "Code" button on the GitHub repository page and select "Open with Code Spaces". This will launch a cloud-based development environment where you can start coding without any local setup.

4. **Customize Automation:** 
   - Customize the automation scripts and rules in the `.github/workflows/` directory. Configure issue management, release automation, and code quality checks according to your project requirements.

5. **Documentation:** 
   - Update the project's documentation to reflect your project's specific setup, workflows, and guidelines.

6. **Requirement.txt:**
   - Update the `requirements.txt` file to ensure all necessary Python packages have been included.
